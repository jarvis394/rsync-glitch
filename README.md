# rsync-node

Have an external server but do not have an access to a professional code editor?
Try using free [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) platform as not hosting but a code editor in your browser!

### Usage

It is good to use `rsync-node` when:
- you don't have an access to an editor but still want to program your app which runs on an external server
- the Glitch does not provide you enough of RAM memory and you want to use your own server
- you are just curious what does this package!
